# HTTP server mini project

Created an HTTP server using Express as practice. The project is a minigame simulating going into a hospital for a kidney problem. With a patient John having healthy or unhealthy kidneys. 
To study and practice the request and resend methods used - the following comparisons have been drawn- 

A) Request methods -
 1) GET- Equivalent to going for a consultation to get a check up. Fiding out the number or healthy and unhealthy kidneys.
 2) POST- Equivalent to going to the doctor to get a new healthy kidney inserted.
 3) PUT- Equivalent to going to get all the unhealthy kidneys present with healthy kidneys.
 4) DELETE- Equivalent to getting the unhealthy kidneys removed.

B) Resend methods (status codes)-
 1) 200- Everything went fine.
 2) 404- Doctor is not in the hospital.
 3) 500- Mid surgery light went away.
 4) 411- Inputs were incorrect. Equivalent to wrong person came for surgery.
